### How to use
The initial page is an overview of each province and focuses on a specific month. Use the slider to change this month throughout the covid timeline. The drop down lets you select between cases, deaths, hospitalized and ICU cases.

To focus on a specific province click the bar on the chart that you would like. From here you can use the multi select dropdown to select several provinces at one time. The slider again lets you slide through the covid timeline. The darker gray area in the background of the charts represents lockdown periods so you can gain insight as to cases during those times.
